# Autonomous Warehouse Robot Control with ROS2, Gazebo, and MAVLink

This project demonstrates a simplified approach to controlling autonomous warehouse robots using ROS2, Gazebo, and MAVLink. It is an interesting and complex project that integrates various technologies.

## Steps to Follow

1. Set up the ROS2 environment and integrate the Gazebo simulation. Create a simple warehouse environment in Gazebo.

2. Choose or create a simple robot model (e.g., a differential drive robot with two wheels). Prepare the robot's Gazebo model and the necessary ROS nodes/packages.

3. Develop a simple command-sending interface from a console for remote control. This can be a simple GUI using Qt. Add a few buttons/fields where the user can specify the robot's target position or movements.

4. Send messages from the console to the robot in Gazebo using the MAVLink protocol. The messages can include basic motion commands (e.g., move forward, turn).

5. Create a ROS node on the robot that processes the incoming MAVLink messages, converts them into appropriate ROS messages/commands, and moves the robot accordingly.

6. For autonomous driving, add simple sensors (e.g., a simulated laser scanner in Gazebo) to enable the robot to detect obstacles. Implement a simple autonomous navigation algorithm (e.g., potential fields).

Writing the full implementation of these steps will be an extensive task, but it can serve as a good starting point for a simple prototype. The choice between Python and C++ is up to you. Python may be easier to start with, but C++ has performance advantages. Qt is a highly capable framework and can be used to create an advanced user interface.

## Project Structure

- `warehouse_robot.py`: The main ROS2 node that controls the robot. It includes obstacle detection, MAVLink communication, and a simple navigation algorithm.
- `robotcontrol.ui`: The Qt Designer file that defines the user interface for remote control.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

- ROS2
- Gazebo
- MAVLink (pymavlink)
- Qt5

## Usage

1. Set up the ROS2 and Gazebo environment.
2. Run the Gazebo simulation with the warehouse environment and the robot model.
3. Launch the `warehouse_robot.py` node to start the robot control.
4. Use the Qt-based user interface to send remote control commands to the robot.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more advanced navigation algorithms.
- Add robust error handling and address potential communication issues.
- Enhance the user interface with more features and controls.
- Integrate additional sensors and functionalities.
